title: The Block Diagonal Infinite Hidden Markov Model
abstract: The Infinite Hidden Markov Model (IHMM) extends hidden Markov models to
  have a countably infinite number of hidden states \citeihmm,hdp. We present a generalization
  of this framework that introduces block-diagonal structure in the transitions between
  the hidden states. These blocks correspond to “sub-behaviors” exhibited by data
  sequences. In identifying such structure, the model classifies, or partitions, sequence
  data according to these sub-behaviors in an unsupervised way. We present an application
  of this model to artificial data, a video gesture classification task, and a musical
  theme labeling task, and show that components of the model can also be applied to
  graph segmentation.
