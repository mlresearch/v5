title: The Block Diagonal Infinite Hidden Markov Model
abstract: The Infinite Hidden Markov Model (IHMM) extends hidden Markov models to
  have a countably infinite number of hidden states \cite{ihmm,hdp}. We present a
  generalization of this framework that introduces block-diagonal structure in the
  transitions between the hidden states. These blocks correspond to ``sub-behaviors''
  exhibited by data sequences. In identifying such structure, the model classifies,
  or partitions, sequence data according to these sub-behaviors in an unsupervised
  way. We present an application of this model to artificial data, a video gesture
  classification task, and a musical theme labeling task, and show that components
  of the model can also be applied to graph segmentation.
