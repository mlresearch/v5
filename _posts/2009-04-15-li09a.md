title: Kernel Learning by Unconstrained Optimization
abstract: We study the problem of learning a kernel matrix from an  apriori kernel
  and training data. In this context, we propose a new unconstrained convex optimization
  formulation, with an  arbitrary convex second-order differentiable loss function
  on kernel  entries and a LogDet divergence term for regularization. Since the  number
  of variables is of order O(n^2), the computational cost of  standard Newton and
  quasi-Newton methods for learning a kernel  matrix is prohibitive. Here an operator
  form Hessian is  used to develop an O(n^3) trust-region inexact Newton method,  where
  the Newton direction is computed using several conjugate  gradient steps on the
  Hessian operator equation. On the uspst  dataset, our algorithm can handle 2 million
  optimization variables  within one hour. Experiments are shown for both linear (Mahalanobis)  metric
  learning and for kernel learning. The convergence rate, speed  and performance of
  several loss functions and algorithms are  discussed.
