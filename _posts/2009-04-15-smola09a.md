title: Relative Novelty Detection
abstract: Novelty detection is an important tool for unsupervised data   analysis.
  It relies on finding regions of low density within which   events are then flagged
  as novel. By design this is dependent on the   underlying measure of the space.
  In this paper we derive a   formulation which is able to address this problem by
  allowing for a   reference measure to be given in the form of a sample from an   alternate
  distribution. We show that this optimization problem can   be solved efficiently
  and that it works well in practice.
