title: Covariance Operator Based Dimensionality Reduction  with Extension to Semi-Supervised
  Settings
abstract: We consider the task of dimensionality reduction for regression (DRR) informed
  by real-valued multivariate labels. The problem is often treated as a regression
  task where the goal is to find a low dimensional representation of the input data
  that preserves the statistical correlation with the targets. Recently, Covariance
  Operator Inverse Regression (COIR) was proposed as an effective solution that exploits
  the covariance structures of both input and output. COIR addresses known limitations
  of recent DRR techniques and allows a closed-form solution without resorting to
  explicit output space slicing often required by existing IR-based methods. In this
  work we provide a unifying view of COIR and other DRR techniques and relate them
  to the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods including the canonical
  correlation analysis (CCA) and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We then show
  that COIR can be effectively extended to a semi-supervised learning setting where
  many of the input points lack their corresponding multivariate targets. A study
  of benefits of proposed approaches is presented on several important regression
  problems in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings.
