title: A New Perspective for Information Theoretic Feature Selection
abstract: "Feature Filters are among the simplest and  fastest approaches to feature
  selection. A “filter”  defines a statistical criterion, used to rank  features on
  how useful they are expected to  be for classification. The highest ranking features
  \ are retained, and the lowest ranking can  be discarded.  A common approach is
  to use  the Mutual Information between the features  and class label. This area
  has seen a recent  flurry of activity, resulting in a confusing variety  of heuristic
  criteria all based on mutual  information, and a lack of a principled way  to understand
  or relate them. The contribution  of this paper is a unifying theoretical  understanding
  of such filters. In contrast to current  methods which manually construct fi\flter
  criteria  with particular properties, we show how  to naturally derive a space of
  possible ranking  criteria. We will show that several recent  contributions in the
  feature selection literature  are points within this space, and that  there exist
  many points that have never been  explored."
