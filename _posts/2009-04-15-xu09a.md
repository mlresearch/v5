title: Tree-Based Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixtures
abstract: 'The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a widely used model for clustering
  and for general nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Unfortunately, like in
  many statistical models, exact inference in a DPM is intractable, and  approximate
  methods are needed to perform efficient inference. While most attention in the literature
  has been placed on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), variational Bayesian (VB) and
  collapsed variational methods, Heller and Ghahramani (2005) recently introduced
  a novel class of approximation for DPMs based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering
  (BHC). These tree-based combinatorial approximations efficiently sum over exponentially
  many ways of partitioning the data and offer a novel lower bound on the marginal
  likelihood of the DPM. In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) We
  show empirically that the BHC lower bounds are substantially tighter than the bounds
  given by VB and by collapsed variational methods on synthetic and real datasets.
  (2) We also show that BHC offers a more accurate predictive performance on these
  datasets. (3) We further improve the tree-based lower bounds with an algorithm that
  efficiently sums contributions from alternative trees. (4) We present a fast approximate
  method for BHC. Our results suggest that our combinatorial approximate inference
  methods and lower bounds may be useful not only in DPMs but in other models as well.'
