title: Convex Perturbations for Scalable Semidefinite Programming
abstract: 'Many important machine learning problems are modeled and solved via semidefinite
  programs; examples include metric learning, nonlinear embedding, and certain clustering
  problems. Often, off-the-shelf software is invoked for the associated optimization,
  which can be inappropriate due to excessive computational and storage requirements.  In
  this paper, we introduce the use of convex perturbations for solving semidefinite
  programs (SDPs), and for a specific perturbation we derive an algorithm that has
  several advantages over existing techniques: a) it is simple, requiring only a few
  lines of Matlab, b) it is a first-order method, and thereby scalable, and c) it
  can easily exploit the structure of a given SDP (e.g., when the constraint matrices
  are low-rank, a situation common to several machine learning SDPs). A pleasant byproduct
  of our method is a fast, kernelized version of the large-margin nearest neighbor
  metric learning algorithm.  We demonstrate that our algorithm is effective in finding
  fast approximations to large-scale SDPs arising in some machine learning applications.'
