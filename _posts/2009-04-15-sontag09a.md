title: Tree Block Coordinate Descent for MAP in Graphical Models
abstract: A number of linear programming relaxations have been proposed for finding
  most likely settings of the variables (MAP) in large probabilistic models. The relaxations
  are often succinctly expressed in the dual and reduce to different types of reparameterizations
  of the original model. The dual objectives are typically solved by performing local
  block coordinate descent steps. In this work, we show how to perform block coordinate
  descent on spanning trees of the graphical model. We also show how all of the earlier
  dual algorithms are related to each other, giving transformations from one type
  of reparameterization to another while maintaining monotonicity relative to a common
  objective function. Finally, we quantify when the MAP solution can and cannot be
  decoded directly from the dual LP relaxation.
