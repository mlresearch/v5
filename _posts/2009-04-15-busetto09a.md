title: Structure Identification by Optimized Interventions
abstract: We consider the problem of optimal experimental design in structure identification.
  Whereas standard approaches simply minimize Shannonâ€™s entropy of the estimated parameter
  posterior, we show how to select between alternative model configurations, too.
  Our method specifies the intervention that makes an experiment capable of determining
  whether or not a particular configuration hypothesis is correct. This is performed
  by a novel clustering technique in approximated Bayesian parameter estimation for
  non-linear dynamical systems. The computation of the perturbation that minimizes
  the effective number of clusters in the belief state is constrained by the increase
  of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the parameter prior and the
  posterior. This enables the disambiguation of persisting alternative explanations
  in cases where standard design systematically fails. Its applicability is illustrated
  with a biochemical Goodwin model, showing correct identification between multiple
  kinetic structures. We expect that our approach will prove useful especially for
  complex structures with reduced observability and multimodal posteriors.
