title: Sampling Techniques for the Nystrom Method
abstract: The Nystrom method is an efficient technique to generate low-rank matrix   approximations
  and is used in several large-scale learning applications. A   key aspect of this
  method is the distribution according to which columns are   sampled from the original
  matrix.  In this work, we present an analysis of   different sampling techniques
  for the Nystrom method. Our analysis includes   both empirical and theoretical components.
  We first present novel experiments   with several real world datasets, comparing
  the performance of the Nystrom   method when used with uniform versus non-uniform
  sampling distributions. Our   results suggest that uniform sampling without replacement,
  in addition to being   more efficient both in time and space, produces more effective
  approximations.   This motivates the theoretical part of our analysis which gives
  the first   performance bounds for the Nystrom method precisely when used with uniform   sampling
  without replacement.
