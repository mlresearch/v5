title: Hash Kernels
abstract: We propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. This generalizes    previous
  work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute    the kernel matrix
  for data streams and sparse feature    spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds
  from the exact kernel    matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings
  and graphs.
