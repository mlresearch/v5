title: Exploiting Probabilistic Independence for Permutations
abstract: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real  world problems, such as voting,
  rankings  and data association.   Representing  uncertainty over permutations is  challenging,
  since there are $n!$  possibilities. Recent Fourier-based  approaches can be used
  to provide a compact representation  over low-frequency components of the distribution.
  Though polynomial,  the complexity of these representations grows very rapidly,
  especially  if we want to maintain reasonable estimates for peaked distributions.   In
  this paper, we first characterize the notion of probabilistic independence   for  distribution
  over permutations.   We then present a method for factoring distributions into  independent
  components in the Fourier domain,  and use our algorithms to decompose large  problems
  into much smaller ones.  We demonstrate that our method provides very significant
  improvements  in terms of running time, on real tracking data.
