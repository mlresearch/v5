title: Supervised Spectral Latent Variable Models
abstract: We present a probabilistic structured prediction method for learning input-output
  dependencies where correlations between outputs are modeled as low-dimensional manifolds
  constrained by both geometric, distance preserving output relations,and predictive
  power of inputs. Technically this reduces to learning a probabilistic, input conditional
  model, over latent (manifold) and output variables using an alternation scheme.
  In one round, we optimize the parameters of an input-driven manifold predictor using
  latent targets given by preimages (conditional expectations) of the current manifold-to-output
  model. In the next round, we use the distribution given by the manifold predictor
  in order to maximize the probability of the outputs with an additional, implicit
  distance preserving constraint on the manifold. The resulting Supervised Spectral
  Latent Variable Model (SSLVM) combines the properties of probabilistic geometric
  manifold learning (accommodates geometric constraints corresponding to any spectral
  embedding method including PCA, ISOMAP or Laplacian Eigenmaps), with the additional
  supervisory information to further constrain it for predictive tasks. We demonstrate
  the superiority of the method over baseline PPCA + regression frameworks and show
  its potential in difficult realworld computer vision benchmarks designed for the
  reconstruction of three-dimensional human poses from monocular image sequences.
