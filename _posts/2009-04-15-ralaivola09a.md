title: Chromatic PAC-Bayes Bounds for Non-IID Data
abstract: PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for
  classifiers learned with IID data, and it    is particularly so for margin classifiers.  However,
  there are many    practical cases where the training data show some dependencies
  and    where the traditional IID assumption does not apply. Stating    generalization
  bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost    interest, both from theoretical
  and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the first – to the best
  of our knowledge –  PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on
  data    exhibiting dependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our    results
  is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency    graph that encodes the
  dependencies within the data, in sets of    independent data, through the tool of
  graph fractional covers.  Our    bounds are very general, since being able to find
  an upper bound on    the (fractional) chromatic number of the dependency graph is    sufficient
  to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our results
  can be used to derive bounds for bipartite    ranking and windowed prediction on
  sequential data.
