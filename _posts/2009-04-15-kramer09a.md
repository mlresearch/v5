title: Lanczos Approximations for the Speedup of Kernel Partial Least Squares Regression
abstract: The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is
  quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity
  measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more
  detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes  a computational
  bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which
  not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and
  (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between
  Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric
  matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel
  matrix in quadratic runtime.
