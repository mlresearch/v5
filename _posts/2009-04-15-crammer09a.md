title: Gaussian Margin Machines
abstract: We introduce Gaussian Margin Machines   (GMMs), which maintain a Gaussian
  distribu-   tion over weight vectors for binary classiﬁcation.   The learning algorithm
  for these machines   seeks the least informative distribution that will   classify
  the training data correctly with high   probability. One formulation can be expressed   as
  a convex constrained optimization problem   whose solution can be represented linearly   in
  terms of training instances and their inner   and outer products, supporting kernelization.   The
  algorithm has a natural PAC-Bayesian   generalization bound. A preliminary evaluation   on
  handwriting recognition data shows that our   algorithm improves over SVMs for the
  same   task.   methods, we maintain a distribution over alternative weight   vectors,
  rather than committing to a single speciﬁc one.   However, these distributions are
  not derived by Bayes? rule.   Instead, they represent our knowledge of the weights
  given   constraints imposed by the training examples. Speciﬁcally,   we use a Gaussian
  distribution over weight vectors with   mean and covariance parameters that are
  learned from the   training data. The learning algorithm seeks for a distribu-   tion
  with a small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from a   ﬁxed isotropic distribution,
  such that each training exam-   ple is correctly classiﬁed by a strict majority
  of the weight   vectors. Conceptually, this is a large-margin probabilistic   principle,
  instead of the geometric large margin principle   in SVMs.   The learning problem
  for GMMs can be expressed as a   convex constrained optimization, and its optimal
  solution
