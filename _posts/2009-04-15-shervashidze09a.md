title: Efficient graphlet kernels for large graph comparison
abstract: State-of-the-art  graph kernels do not scale to large graphs with hundreds
  of nodes and thousands of edges. In this article we propose to compare graphs by
  counting graphlets, i.e., subgraphs with $k$ nodes where $k \in \{ 3, 4, 5 \}$. Exhaustive
  enumeration of all graphlets being prohibitively expensive, we introduce two theoretically
  grounded speedup schemes, one based on sampling and the second one specifically
  designed for bounded degree graphs. In our experimental evaluation, our novel kernels
  allow us to efficiently compare large graphs that cannot be tackled by existing
  graph kernels.
