title: Efficient graphlet kernels for large graph comparison
abstract: State-of-the-art  graph kernels do not scale to large graphs with hundreds
  of nodes and thousands of edges. In this article we propose to compare graphs by
  counting  {\it graphlets}, \ie subgraphs with $k$ nodes where $k \in \{ 3, 4, 5
  \}$. Exhaustive enumeration of all graphlets being prohibitively expensive, we introduce
  two theoretically grounded speedup schemes, one based on sampling and the second
  one specifically designed for bounded degree graphs. In our experimental evaluation,
  our novel kernels allow us to efficiently compare large graphs that cannot be tackled
  by existing graph kernels.
