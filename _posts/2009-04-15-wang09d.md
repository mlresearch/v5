title: Large-Margin Structured Prediction via Linear Programming
abstract: This paper presents a novel learning algorithm for structured classification
  problems, where the task is to predict multiple and interacting labels (multilabel)
  for an input object. The maximum margin separation between the correct multilabels
  and the incorrect ones is formulated as a linear program.  Instead of explicitly
  writing out the entire problem with an exponentially large  constraint set, the
  linear program is solved iteratively via column generation. In this case, the process
  of generating most violated constraints is equivalent to searching for highest-scored
  misclassified incorrect multilabels, which can be easily achieved by decoding the
  structure based on current estimations.  In addition, we also explore the integration
  of the column generation and the extragradient method for linear programming to
  gain further efficiency. Compared to previous works on large-margin structured prediction,
  this framework has advantages in handling arbitrary structures and larger-scale  problems.
  Experimental results on part-of-speech tagging and statistical machine translation
  tasks are reported, demonstrating the competitiveness of the proposed approach.
