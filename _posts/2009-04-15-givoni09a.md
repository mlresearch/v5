title: Semi-Supervised Affinity Propagation with Instance-Level Constraints
abstract: 'Recently, affinity propagation (AP) was introduced  as an unsupervised
  learning algorithm for  exemplar based clustering. Here we extend the  AP model
  to account for semi-supervised clustering.  AP, which is formulated as inference
  in  a factor-graph, can be naturally extended to account  for ?instance-level? constraints:
  pairs of  data points that cannot belong to the same cluster  (cannot-link), or
  must belong to the same cluster  (must-link). We present a semi-supervised AP algorithm  (SSAP)
  that can use instance-level constraints  to guide the clustering. We demonstrate  the
  applicability of SSAP to interactive image  segmentation by using SSAP to cluster
  superpixels  while taking into account user instructions regarding  which superpixels
  belong to the same object.  We demonstrate SSAP can achieve better  performance
  compared to other semi-supervised  methods.'
