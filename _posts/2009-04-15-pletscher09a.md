title: Spanning Tree Approximations for Conditional Random Fields
abstract: 'In this work we show that one can train Conditional Random Fields of intractable
  graphs effectively and efficiently by considering a mixture of random spanning trees
  of the underlying graphical model. Furthermore, we show how a maximum-likelihood
  estimator of such a training objective can subsequently be used for prediction on
  the full graph. We present experimental results which improve on the state-of-the-art.
  Additionally, the training objective is less sensitive to the regularization than
  pseudo-likelihood based training approaches. We perform the experimental validation
  on two classes of data sets where structure is important: image denoising and multilabel
  classification.'
