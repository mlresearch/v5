title: Handling Sparsity via the Horseshoe
abstract: This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse supervised-learning
  problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family
  of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely
  used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian
  priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine).
  The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity
  and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation
  theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its
  performance to benchmark alternatives.
