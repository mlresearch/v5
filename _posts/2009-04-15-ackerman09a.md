title: 'Clusterability: A Theoretical Study'
abstract: We investigate measures of the clusterability of data sets. Namely, ways
  to define how ‘strong’ or ‘conclusive’ is the clustering structure of a given data
  set. We address this issue with generality, aiming for conclusions that apply regardless
  of any particular clustering algorithm or any specific data generation  model.    We
  survey several notions of clusterability that have been discussed in the literature,
  as well as propose a new notion of data clusterability.    Our comparison of these
  notions reveals that, although they all attempt to evaluate the same intuitive property,
  they are pairwise inconsistent.    Our analysis discovers an interesting phenomenon;
  Although most of the common clustering tasks are NP-hard, finding a close-to-optimal
  clustering for well-clusterable data sets is easy (computationally). We prove instances
  of this general claim with respect to the various clusterability notions that we
  discuss.    Finally, we investigate how hard it is to determine the clusterability
  value of a given data set. In most cases, it turns out that this is an NP-hard problem.
