title: Factorial Mixture of Gaussians and the Marginal Independence Model
abstract: Marginal independence constraints play an important role in learning  with
  graphical models. One way of parameterizing a model of marginal  independencies
  is by building a latent variable model where two  independent observed variables
  have no common latent source. In sparse  domains, however, it might be advantageous
  to model the marginal  observed distribution directly, without explicitly including
  latent  variables in the model. There have been recent advances in Gaussian  and
  binary models of marginal independence, but no models with  non-linear dependencies
  between continuous variables has been proposed  so far. In this paper, we describe
  how to generalize the Gaussian  model of marginal independencies based on mixtures,
  and how to learn  parameters. This requires a non-standard parameterization and
  raises  difficult non-linear optimization issues.
