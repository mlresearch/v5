title: MCMC Methods for Bayesian Mixtures of Copulas
abstract: 'Applications of copula models have been increasing in number in recent  years.
  This class of models provides a modular parameterization of  joint distributions:
  the specification of the marginal distributions  is parameterized separately from
  the dependence structure of the  joint, a convenient way of encoding a model for
  domains such as  finance. Some recent advances on how to specify copulas for arbitrary  dimensions
  have been proposed, by means of mixtures of decomposable  graphical models. This
  paper introduces a Bayesian approach for  dealing with mixtures of copulas which,
  due to the lack of prior  conjugacy, raise computational challenges. We motivate
  and present  families of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that exploit
  the  particular structure of mixtures of copulas. Different algorithms are  evaluated
  according to their mixing properties, and an application in  financial forecasting
  with missing data illustrates the usefulness of  the methodology.'
