title: Learning Thin Junction Trees via Graph Cuts
abstract: 'Structure learning algorithms usually focus on  the compactness of the
  learned model. However,  compact representation does not imply the existence  of
  tractable inference algorithms: both exact  and approximate inference may still
  be NP-hard.  This focus on compactness leads to learning  good models that require
  approximate inference  techniques, thus reducing their prediction  quality. In this
  paper, we propose a method for  learning an attractive class of models: bounded
  treewidth  junction trees. Those models permit  both compact representation of probability
  distributions  and efficient exact inference.  Our method uses a new global criterion
  to construct  the tree. Our criterion, based on a Bethe  approximation of the likelihood,
  transforms the  structure learning problem into an intuitive graph  theoretical
  task.  We present an efficient randomized algorithm  with theoretical guarantees
  for finding good separators.  We recursively apply this procedure to  obtain a thin
  junction tree. Our extensive empirical  evaluation demonstrates the benefit of applying  exact
  inference using our models to answer  queries. We also extend our technique to learn  low
  tree-width conditional random fields, and  demonstrate significant improvements
  over state  of the art block-L1 regularization techniques.'
