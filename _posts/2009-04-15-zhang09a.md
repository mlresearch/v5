title: Coherence Functions for Multicategory Margin-based Classification Methods
abstract: Margin-based classification methods are typically devised based on a majorization-minimization
  procedure, which approximately solves an  otherwise intractable minimization problem
  defined with the 0-l loss. However, extension of such methods from the binary classification
  setting to the more general multicategory setting turns out to be non-trivial. In
  this paper, our focus is to devise margin-based classification methods that can
  be seamlessly applied to both settings, with the binary setting simply as a special
  case. In particular, we propose a new majorization loss function that we call the
  coherence function, and then devise a new multicategory margin-based boosting algorithm
  based on the coherence function. Analogous to deterministic annealing, the coherence
  function is characterized by a temperature factor. It is closely related to the
  multinomial log-likelihood function and its limit at zero temperature corresponds
  to a multicategory hinge loss function.
