title: Non-Negative Semi-Supervised Learning
abstract: The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we present a general
  formulation for reaping the benefits from both non-negative data factorization and
  semi-supervised learning, and the solution naturally possesses the characteristics
  of sparsity, robustness to partial occlusions, and greater discriminating power
  via extra unlabeled data. Then, an efficient multiplicative updating procedure is
  proposed along with its theoretic justification of the algorithmic convergency.
  Finally, the tensorization of this general formulation for non-negative semi-supervised
  learning is also briefed for handling tensor data of arbitrary order. Extensive
  experiments compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for non-negative data
  factorization and semi-supervised learning demonstrate the algorithmic properties
  in sparsity, classification power, and robustness to image occlusions.
