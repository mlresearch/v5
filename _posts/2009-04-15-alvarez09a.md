title: Latent Force Models
abstract: Purely data driven approaches for machine learning present difficulties
  when data is scarce relative to the complexity of the model or when the model is
  forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches  need to
  identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which  may not
  be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this
  paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations
  to combine data driven modeling with a physical model of the system. We show how
  different, physically-inspired, kernel functions  can be developed through sensible,
  simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system. The versatility of
  our approach is illustrated with three case studies from computational biology,
  motion capture and geostatistics.
