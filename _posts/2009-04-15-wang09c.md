title: An Information Geometry Approach for Distance Metric Learning
abstract: 'Metric learning is an important problem in machine learning and  pattern
  recognition. In this paper, we propose a framework for  metric learning based on
  information geometry. The key idea is to  construct two kernel matrices for the
  given training data: one is  based on the distance metric and the other is based
  on the assigned  class labels. Inspired by the idea of information geometry, we  relate
  these two kernel matrices to two Gaussian distributions, and  the difference between
  the two kernel matrices is then computed by  the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
  between the two Gaussian  distributions. The optimal distance metric is then found
  by  minimizing the divergence between the two distributions. Based on  this idea,
  we present two metric learning algorithms, one for linear  distance metric and the
  other for nonlinear distance with the  introduction of a kernel function. Unlike
  many existing algorithms  for metric learning that require solving a non-trivial
  optimization  problem and therefore are computationally expensive when the data  dimension
  is high, the proposed algorithms have a closed-form  solution and are computationally
  more efficient. Extensive  experiments with data classification and face recognition
  show that  the proposed algorithms are comparable to or better than the  state-of-the-art
  algorithms for metric learning.'
