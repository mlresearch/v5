title: Tractable Bayesian Inference of Time-Series Dependence Structure
abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian inference over graphical structures
  describing the interactions among multiple vector time-series. A directed temporal
  interaction model is presented which assumes a fixed dependence structure among
  time-series. Using a conjugate prior over this model's structure and parameters,
  we focus our attention on characterizing the exact posterior uncertainty in the
  structure given data. The model is extended via the introduction of a dynamically
  evolving latent variable which indexes dependence structures over time. Performing
  inference using this model yields promising results when analyzing the interaction
  of multiple tracked moving objects.
