title: Tractable Bayesian Inference of Time-Series Dependence Structure
abstract: We consider the problem of Bayesian inference over graphical structures
  describing the interactions among multiple vector time-series. A directed temporal
  interaction model is presented which assumes a fixed dependence structure among
  time-series. Using a conjugate prior over this modelâ€™s structure and parameters,
  we focus our attention on characterizing the exact posterior uncertainty in the
  structure given data. The model is extended via the introduction of a dynamically
  evolving latent variable which indexes dependence structures over time. Performing
  inference using this model yields promising results when analyzing the interaction
  of multiple tracked moving objects.
