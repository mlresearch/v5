title: Learning the Switching Rate by Discretising Bernoulli Sources Online
abstract: 'The expert tracking algorithm Fixed-Share  depends on a parameter alpha,
  called the switching  rate. If the final number of outcomes  T is known in advance,
  then the switching  rate can be learned with regret 1/2 log T +  O(1) bits. The
  current fastest method that  achieves this, Learn-alpha, is based on optimal  discretisation
  of the Bernoulli distributions  into O(√T) bins and runs in O(T√T) time;  however
  the exact locations of these points  have to be determined algorithmically.    This
  paper introduces a new discretisation  scheme with the same regret bound for  known
  T, that specifies the number and positions  of the discretisation points explicitly.  The
  scheme is especially useful when T is not  known in advance: a new fully on-line
  algorithm,  Refine-Online, is presented, which  runs in O(T√T log T) time and achieves
  a  regret of 1/2 log 3 log T + O(log log T) bits.'
