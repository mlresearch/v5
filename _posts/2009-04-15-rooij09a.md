title: Learning the Switching Rate by Discretising Bernoulli Sources Online
abstract: 'The expert tracking algorithm Fixed-Share  depends on a parameter alpha,
  called the switching rate. If the final number of outcomes $T$ is known in advance,
  then the switching rate can be learned with regret $\frac{1}{2} \log T + O(1)$ bits. The
  current fastest method that  achieves this, Learn-alpha, is based on optimal  discretisation
  of the Bernoulli distributions into $O(\sqrt{T})$ bins and runs in $(T\sqrt{T})$ time; however
  the exact locations of these points  have to be determined algorithmically.    This
  paper introduces a new discretisation  scheme with the same regret bound for  known
  $T$, that specifies the number and positions of the discretisation points explicitly. The
  scheme is especially useful when $T$ is not known in advance: a new fully online
  algorithm, Refine-Online, is presented, which  runs in $O(T \sqrt{T} \log T)$ time and achieves
  a  regret of $\frac{1}{2} \log 3 \log T + O(\log \log T)$ bits.'
