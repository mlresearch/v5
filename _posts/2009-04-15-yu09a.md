title: Active Sensing
abstract: Labels are often expensive to get, and this motivates \emphactive learning
  which chooses the most informative samples for label  acquisition. In this paper
  we study \emphactive sensing in a  multi-view setting, motivated from many problems
  where grouped  features are also expensive to obtain and need to be acquired (or  \emphsensed)
  actively (e.g., in cancer diagnosis each patient might  go through many tests such
  as CT, Ultrasound and MRI to get valuable  features). The strength of this model
  is that one actively sensed  (sample, view) pair would improve the \emphjoint multi-view  classification
  on all the samples. For this purpose we extend the  Bayesian co-training framework
  such that it can handle missing views  in a principled way, and introduce two criteria
  for view acquisition.  Experiments on one toy data and two real-world medical problems
  show  the effectiveness of this model.
