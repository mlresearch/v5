title: Relational Topic Models for Document Networks
abstract: We develop the relational topic model (RTM), a model of documents and the
  links between them. For each pair of documents, the RTM models their link as a binary
  random variable that is conditioned on their contents. The model can be used to
  summarize a network of documents, predict links between them, and predict words
  within them. We derive efﬁcient inference and learning algorithms based on variational
  methods and evaluate the predictive performance of the RTM for large networks of
  scientiﬁc abstracts and web documents.
