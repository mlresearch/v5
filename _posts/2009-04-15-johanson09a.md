title: Data Biased Robust Counter Strategies
abstract: The problem of exploiting information about the environment while still
  being robust to inaccurate or incomplete information arises in many domains. Competitive
  imperfect information games where the goal is to maximally exploit an unknown opponent’s
  weaknesses are an example of this problem.  Agents for these games must balance
  two objectives.  First, they should aim to exploit data from past interactions with
  the opponent, seeking a best-response counter strategy.  Second, they should aim
  to minimize losses since the limited data may be misleading or the opponent’s strategy
  may have changed, suggesting an opponent-agnostic Nash equilibrium strategy.  In
  this paper, we show how to partially satisfy both of these objectives at the same
  time, producing strategies with favorable tradeoffs between the ability to exploit
  an opponent and the capacity to be exploited.  Like a recently published technique,
  our approach involves solving a modified game; however the result is more generally
  applicable and even performs well in situations with very limited data.  We evaluate
  our technique in the game of two-player, Limit Texas Hold’em.
