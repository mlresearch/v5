title: 'Optimizing Costly Functions with Simple Constraints: A Limited-Memory Projected
  Quasi-Newton Algorithm'
abstract: An optimization algorithm for minimizing a smooth function over a    convex
  set is described.  Each iteration of the method computes a    descent direction
  by minimizing, over the original constraints, a    diagonal plus low-rank quadratic
  approximation to the function.  The    quadratic approximation is constructed using
  a limited-memory    quasi-Newton update.  The method is suitable for large-scale    problems
  where evaluation of the function is substantially more    expensive than projection
  onto the constraint set.  Numerical    experiments on one-norm regularized test
  problems indicate that the    proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art
  methods such as    bound-constrained L-BFGS and orthant-wise descent. We further
  show    that the method generalizes to a wide class of problems, and     substantially
  improves on state-of-the-art methods for problems such    as learning the structure
  of Gaussian graphical models and Markov random    fields.
