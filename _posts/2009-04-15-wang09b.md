title: Markov Topic Models
abstract: We develop Markov topic models (MTMs), a novel family of generative graphical
  models that can learn topics simultaneously from multiple corpora, such as papers
  from different conferences. We apply Gaussian (Markov) random fields to model the
  correlations of different corpora.  MTMs capture both the internal topic structure
  within each corpus and the relationships between topics across the corpora.  We
  derive an efficient estimation procedure with variational expectation-maximization.  We
  study the performance of our models on a corpus of abstracts from six different
  computer science conferences.  Our analysis reveals qualitative discoveries that
  are not possible with traditional topic models, and improved quantitative performance
  over the state of the art.
