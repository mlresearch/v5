title: Learning a Parametric Embedding by Preserving Local Structure
abstract: The paper presents a new unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique,
  called parametric t-SNE, that learns a parametric mapping between the high-dimensional
  data space and the low-dimensional latent space. Parametric t-SNE learns the parametric
  mapping in such a way that the local structure of the data is preserved as well
  as possible in the latent space.  We evaluate the performance of parametric t-SNE
  in experiments on two datasets, in which we compare it to the performance of two
  other unsupervised parametric dimensionality reduction techniques. The results of
  experiments illustrate the strong performance of parametric t-SNE, in particular,
  in learning settings in which the dimensionality of the latent space is relatively
  low.
