title: Visualization Databases for the Analysis of Large Complex Datasets
abstract: 'Comprehensive visualization that preserves the information in a large complex
  dataset requires a visualization database (VDB): many displays, some with many pages,
  and with one or more panels per page. A single display using a specific display
  method results from partitioning the data into subsets, sampling the subsets, and
  applying the method to each sample, typically one per panel. The time of the analyst
  to generate a display is not increased by choosing a large sample over a small one.
  Displays and display viewers can be designed to allow rapid scanning. Often, it
  is not necessary to view every page of a display. VDBs, already successful just
  with off-the-shelf tools, can be greatly improved by research that rethinks all
  of the areas of data visualization in the context of VDBs.'
