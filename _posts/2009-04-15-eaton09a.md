title: Choosing a Variable to Clamp
abstract: In this paper we propose an algorithm for  approximate inference on graphical
  models  based on belief propagation (BP). Our algorithm  is an approximate version
  of Cutset  Conditioning, in which a set of variables is  instantiated to make the
  rest of the graph  singly connected. We relax the constraint  of single-connectedness,
  and select variables  one at a time for conditioning, running belief  propagation
  after each selection. We consider  the problem of determining the best variable  to
  clamp at each level of recursion, and  propose a fast heuristic which applies backpropagation  to
  the BP updates. We demonstrate  that the heuristic performs better than  selecting
  variables at random, and give experimental  results which show that it performs  competitively
  with existing approximate inference  algorithms.
