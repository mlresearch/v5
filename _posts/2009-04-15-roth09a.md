title: Sequential Learning of Classifiers for Structured Prediction Problems
abstract: Many classification problems with structured outputs can be regarded as
  a set of interrelated sub-problems where constraints  dictate valid variable assignments.  The
  standard approaches to these problems include either independent learning of individual
  classifiers for each of the sub-problems or joint learning of the entire set of
  classifiers with the constraints enforced during learning.  We propose an intermediate
  approach where we learn these classifiers in a sequence using previously learned
  classifiers to guide learning of the next classifier by enforcing constraints between
  their outputs. We provide a theoretical motivation to explain why this learning
  protocol is expected to outperform both alternatives when individual problems have
  different `complexity'. This analysis motivates an algorithm for choosing a preferred
  order of classifier learning. We evaluate our technique on artificial experiments
  and on the entity and relation identification problem where the proposed method  outperforms
  both joint and independent learning.
