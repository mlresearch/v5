title: Exact and Approximate Sampling by Systematic Stochastic Search
abstract: We introduce _adaptive sequential rejection sampling_, an  algorithm for
  generating exact samples from high-dimensional, discrete  distributions, building
  on ideas from classical AI search. Just as  systematic search algorithms like A*
  recursively build complete  solutions from partial solutions, sequential rejection
  sampling  recursively builds exact samples over high-dimensional spaces from  exact
  samples over lower-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm recovers  widely-used particle
  filters as an approximate variant without  adaptation, and a randomized version
  of the directed arc consistency  algorithm with backtracking when applied to deterministic
  problems. In  this paper, we present the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings  of
  our approach and measure its behavior on ferromagnetic Isings and  other probabilistic
  graphical models, obtaining exact and approximate  samples in a range of situations.
