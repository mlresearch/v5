title: Variable Metric Stochastic Approximation Theory
abstract: We provide a variable metric stochastic approximation theory. In doing so,
  we provide a convergence theory for a large class of online variable metric methods
  including the recently introduced online versions of the BFGS algorithm and  its
  limited-memory LBFGS variant. We also discuss the implications of our results in
  the areas of elicitation of properties of distributions using prediction markets
  and in learning from expert advice.
