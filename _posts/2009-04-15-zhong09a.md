title: Reversible Jump MCMC for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
abstract: We present a fully Bayesian approach to Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation
  (NMF) by developing a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) method which
  provides full posteriors over the matrix components. In addition the NMF model selection
  issue is addressed, for the first time, as our RJMCMC procedure provides the posterior  distribution
  over the matrix dimensions and therefore the number of components in the NMF model.
  A comparative analysis is provided with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
  and model selection employing estimates of the marginal likelihood. An illustrative
  synthetic example is provided using blind mixtures of images. This is then followed
  by a large scale study of the recovery of component spectra  from multiplexed Raman
  readouts. The power and flexibility of the Bayesian methodology and the proposed
  RJMCMC procedure to objectively assess  differing model structures and infer the
  corresponding plausible component spectra for this complex data is demonstrated
  convincingly.
