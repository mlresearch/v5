title: A kernel method for unsupervised structured network inference
abstract: 'Network inference is the problem of inferring edges between a set of  real-world
  objects, for instance, interactions between pairs of  proteins in bioinformatics.   Current
  kernel-based approaches to this problem share a set of   common features:   (i)
  they are supervised and hence require labeled training data; (ii)  edges in the
  network are treated as mutually independent   and hence topological properties are
  largely ignored; (iii) they lack  a statistical interpretation.   We argue that
  these common assumptions are often   undesirable for network inference, and propose
  (i) an   unsupervised kernel method (ii) that takes the global structure of the   network
  into account and (iii) is statistically motivated.   We show that our approach can
  explain commonly used heuristics in  statistical terms.  In experiments on social
  networks, different variants of our  method demonstrate appealing predictive performance.'
