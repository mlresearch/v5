title: A Hierarchical Nonparametric Bayesian Approach to Statistical Language Model
  Domain Adaptation
abstract: In this paper we present a doubly hierarchical Pitman-Yor process language
  model. Its bottom layer of hierarchy consists of multiple hierarchical Pitman-Yor
  process language models, one each for some number of domains. The novel top layer
  of hierarchy consists of a mechanism to couple together multiple language models
  such that they share statistical strength. Intuitively this sharing results in the
  ?adaptation? of a latent shared language model to each domain. We introduce a general
  formalism capable of describing the overall model which we call the graphical Pitman-Yor
  process and explain how to perform Bayesian inference in it. We present encouraging
  language model domain adaptation results that both illustrate the potential benefits
  of our new model and suggest new avenues of inquiry.
