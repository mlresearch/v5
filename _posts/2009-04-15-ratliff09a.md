title: Inverse Optimal Heuristic Control for Imitation Learning
abstract: 'Imitation learning is an increasingly important tool for both developing  automatic
  decision making systems as well as for learning to predict  decision-making and
  behavior by observation. Two basic approaches are common:  the first, which we here
  term \emphbehavioral cloning   (BC)\citeBehavioralCloning,ALVINN,DAVE, treats the
  imitation learning problem  as a straightforward one of supervised learning (e.g.
  classification) where the  goal is to map observations to controls.  Secondly, the
  notion of\emphinverse  optimal control (IOC) \citeBoydIOC,ng00irl,Abbeel04c,mmp06
  for  modeling   such decision making behavior has gained prominence as it allows
  for learned   decision-making that reasons sequentially and over a long horizon.  Unfortunately,
  such inverse optimal control methods rely upon the ability to   efficiently solve
  a planning problem and suffer from the usual “curse of  dimensionality” when the
  state space gets large. This paper presents a novel  approach to imitation learning
  that we call \emphInverse Optimal Heuristic  Control (IOHC) which capitalizes on
  the strengths of both paradigms by  allowing long-horizon, planning style reasoning
  in a low dimensional space,  while enabling a high dimensional additional set of
  features to guide overall  action selection.  We frame this combined problem as
  one of optimization, and  although the resulting objective function is actually
  non-convex, we are able  to provide convex upper and lower bounds to optimize as
  surrogates. Further,  these bounds, as well as our empirical results, show that
  the objective   function is nearly convex and leads to improved performance on a
  set of  imitation learning problems including turn prediction of drivers as well
  as  predicting the likely paths taken by pedestrians in an office environment.'
