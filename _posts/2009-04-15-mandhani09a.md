title: Tractable Search for Learning Exponential Models of Rankings
abstract: We consider the problem of learning the Generalized Mallows (GM) model  of
  \cite{fv86}, which represents a probability distribution over all  possible permutations
  (aka rankings) of a given set of objects. The  training data consists of a set of
  permutations. This problem  generalizes the well known rank aggregation problem.
  Maximum  Likelihood estimation of the GM model is NP-hard. An exact but  inefficient
  search-based method was recently proposed for this  problem. Here we introduce the
  first non-trivial heuristic function  for this search. We justify it theoretically,
  and show why it is  admissible in practice. We experimentally demonstrate its  effectiveness,
  and show that it is superior to existing techniques for  learning the GM model.
  We also show good performance of a family of  faster approximate methods of search.
