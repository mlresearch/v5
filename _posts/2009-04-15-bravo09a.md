title: Estimating Tree-Structured Covariance Matrices via Mixed-Integer Programming
abstract: We present a novel method for estimating tree-structured covariance matrices
  directly from observed  continuous data. A representation of these classes of matrices
  as linear combinations  of rank-one matrices indicating object partitions is used
  to formulate estimation as  instances of well-studied numerical optimization problems.    In
  particular, our estimates are based on projection, where the covariance estimate  is
  the nearest tree-structured covariance matrix to an observed sample covariance matrix.  The
  problem is posed as a linear or quadratic mixed-integer program (MIP) where  a setting
  of the integer variables in the MIP specifies a set of tree topologies of the structured  covariance
  matrix. We solve these problems to optimality using efficient and robust existing
  MIP solvers.    We present a case study in phylogenetic analysis of expression in
  yeast gene families and a comparison using simulated data to distance-based tree
  estimating procedures.
