title: Probabilistic Models for Incomplete Multi-dimensional Arrays
abstract: In multiway data, each sample is measured by multiple sets of  correlated
  attributes. We develop a probabilistic framework for  modeling structural dependency
  from partially observed  multi-dimensional array data, known as pTucker. Latent
  components  associated with individual array dimensions are jointly retrieved  while
  the core tensor is integrated out. The resulting algorithm  is capable of handling
  large-scale data sets. We verify the  usefulness of this approach by comparing against
  classical models  on applications to modeling amino acid fluorescence, collaborative  filtering
  and a number of benchmark multiway array data.
