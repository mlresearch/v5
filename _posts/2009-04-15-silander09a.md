title: Locally Minimax Optimal Predictive Modeling with Bayesian Networks
abstract: We propose an information-theoretic approach for predictive modeling    with
  Bayesian networks.  Our approach is based on the minimax    optimal Normalized Maximum
  Likelihood (NML) distribution, motivated    by the MDL principle. In particular,
  we present a parameter learning    method which, together with a previously introduced
  NML-based model    selection criterion, provides a way to construct highly predictive    Bayesian
  network models from data. The method is parameter-free and    robust, unlike the
  currently popular Bayesian marginal likelihood    approach which has been shown
  to be sensitive to the choice of prior    hyperparameters. Empirical tests show
  that the proposed method    compares favorably with the Bayesian approach in predictive
  tasks.
