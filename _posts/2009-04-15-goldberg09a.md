title: Multi-Manifold Semi-Supervised Learning
abstract: We study semi-supervised learning when the data consists of multiple intersecting
  manifolds.  We give a finite sample analysis to quantify the potential gain of using
  unlabeled data in this multi-manifold setting.  We then propose a semi-supervised
  learning algorithm that separates different manifolds into decision sets, and performs
  supervised learning within each set.  Our algorithm involves a novel application
  of Hellinger distance and size-constrained spectral clustering.  Experiments demonstrate
  the benefit of our multi-manifold semi-supervised learning approach.
