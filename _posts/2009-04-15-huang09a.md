title: Maximum Entropy Density Estimation with Incomplete Presence-Only Data
abstract: We demonstrate a generalization of Maximum Entropy Density Estimation that
  elegantly handles incomplete presence-only data. We provide a formulation that is
  able to learn from known values of incomplete data without having to learn imputed
  values, which may be inaccurate. This saves the effort needed to perform accurate
  imputation while observing the principle of maximum entropy throughout the learning
  process. We provide analysis and examples of our algorithm under different settings
  of missing data.
