title: Learning Low Density Separators
abstract: We define a novel, basic, unsupervised learning problem - learning  the
  lowest density homogeneous hyperplane separator of an  unknown probability distribution.  This
  task is relevant to several  problems in machine learning, such as semi-supervised
  learning and  clustering stability.  We investigate the question of existence of
  a  universally consistent algorithm for this problem. We propose two  natural learning
  paradigms and prove that, on input unlabeled random  samples generated by any member
  of a rich family of distributions,  they are guaranteed to converge to the optimal
  separator for that  distribution. We complement this result by showing that no learning  algorithm
  for our task can achieve uniform learning rates (that are  independent of the data
  generating distribution).
