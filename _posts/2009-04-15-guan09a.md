title: Sparse Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis
abstract: "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a  popular dimensionality reduction
  algorithm.  However, it is not easy to interpret which of  the original features
  are important based on  the principal components. Recent methods  improve interpretability
  by sparsifying PCA  through adding an L1 regularizer. In this paper,  we introduce
  a probabilistic formulation  for sparse PCA. By presenting sparse PCA  as a probabilistic
  Bayesian formulation, we  gain the bene\ft of automatic model selection.  We examine
  three di\verent priors for achieving  sparsi\fcation: (1) a two-level hierarchical
  \ prior equivalent to a Laplacian distribution  and consequently to an L1 regularization,
  (2)  an inverse-Gaussian prior, and (3) a Je\vrey's  prior. We learn these models
  by applying  variational inference. Our experiments verify  that indeed our sparse
  probabilistic model  results in a sparse PCA solution."
