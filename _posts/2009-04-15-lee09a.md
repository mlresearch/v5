title: Group Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for EEG Classification
abstract: Given EEG data measured from several subjects under the same condition,  our
  goal is to estimate common task-related bases in a linear model  that capture intra-subject
  variations as well as inter-subject variations.  Such bases capture the common phenomenon
  in a group data, which is known as group analysis.  In this paper we present a method
  of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) that  is well suited to analyze EEG data
  of multiple subjects.  The method is referred to as group nonnegative matrix factorization
  (GNMF)  where we seek task-related common bases reflecting both intra-subject and  inter-subject
  variations, as well as bases involving individual characteristics.  We compare GNMF
  with NMF and some modified NMFs, in a task of learning spectral features  from EEG
  data. Experiments on BCI competition data indicate that GNMF improves  the EEG classification
  performance. In addition, we also show that GNMF is useful  in a task of subject-to-subject
  transfer where the prediction for an unseen subject  is performed based on a linear
  model learned from different subjects in the same group.
