title: Statistical and Computational Tradeoffs in Stochastic Composite Likelihood
abstract: Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to
  the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators
  that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. We prove
  the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance
  and computational complexity, and discuss experimental results in the context of
  Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The theoretical and experimental
  studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators in achieving a predefined
  balance between computational complexity and statistical accuracy.
