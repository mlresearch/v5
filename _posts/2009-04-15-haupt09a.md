title: 'Distilled sensing: selective sampling for sparse signal recovery'
abstract: A selective sampling methodology called Distilled Sensing (DS) is proposed
  for recovering sparse signals in noise.  DS exploits the fact that it is often easier
  to rule out locations that do not contain signal than it is to detect the locations
  of non-zero signal components.  We formalize this observation and use it to devise
  a sequential selective sensing strategy that focuses sensing/measurement resources
  towards the signal subspace.  This adaptivity in sensing results in rather surprising
  gains in sparse signal recovery compared to non-adaptive sensing.  We show that
  exponentially weaker sparse signals can be recovered via DS compared with conventional
  non-adaptive sensing.
