title: Deep Learning using Robust Interdependent Codes
abstract: We investigate a simple yet effective method to introduce inhibitory and  excitatory
  interactions between units in the layers of a deep neural  network classifier. The
  method is based on the greedy layer-wise procedure  of deep learning algorithms
  and extends the denoising autoencoder of  Vincent et al. \citeVincentPLarochelleH2008-small
  by adding asymmetric  lateral connections between its hidden coding units, in a
  manner that is much simpler and  computationally more efficient than previously
  proposed approaches.We  present experiments on two character recognition problems
  which show for  the first time that lateral connections can significantly improve
  the  classification performance of deep networks.
