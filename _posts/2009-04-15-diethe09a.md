title: Matching Pursuit Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
abstract: We derive a novel sparse version of Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
  (KFDA) using an approach based on Matching Pursuit (MP). We call this algorithm
  Matching Pursuit Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (MPKFDA). We provide generalisation
  error bounds analogous to those constructed for the Robust Minimax algorithm together
  with a sample compression bounding technique. We present experimental results on
  real world datasets, which show that MPKFDA is competitive with the KFDA and the
  SVM on UCI datasets, and additional experiments that show that the MPKFDA on average
  outperforms KFDA and SVM in extremely high dimensional settings.
