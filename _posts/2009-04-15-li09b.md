title: Latent Wishart Processes for Relational Kernel Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel relational kernel learning model based
  on  latent Wishart processes (LWP) to learn the kernel function for relational data.  This
  is done by seamlessly integrating the relational information and the input attributes
  into the kernel learning process.  Through extensive experiments on diverse real-world
  applications, we demonstrate that our LWP model can give very promising performance
  in practice.
