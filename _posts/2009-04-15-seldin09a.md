title: PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound for Density Estimation with Application to
  Co-clustering
abstract: We derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for density estimation.  Similar
  to the PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for classification, the  result has the
  appealingly simple form of a tradeoff between empirical  performance and the KL-divergence
  of the posterior from the  prior. Moreover, the PAC-Bayesian generalization bound
  for  classification can be derived as a special case of the bound for density  estimation.    To
  illustrate a possible application of our bound we derive a  generalization bound
  for co-clustering. The bound provides a criterion  to evaluate the ability of co-clustering
  to predict new co-occurrences,  thus introducing a supervised flavor to this traditionally
  unsupervised task.
