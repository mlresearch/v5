title: On Partitioning Rules for Bipartite Ranking
abstract: "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the  properties of partitioning
  scoring rules in the  bipartite ranking setup. We focus on ranking  rules based
  on scoring functions. General suf-  \fcient conditions for the AUC consistency of
  \ scoring functions that are constant on cells  of a partition of the feature space
  are provided.  Rate bounds are obtained for cubic  histogram scoring rules under
  mild smoothness  assumptions on the regression function.  In this setup, it is shown
  how to penalize the  empirical AUC criterion in order to select a  scoring rule
  nearly as good as the one that  can be built when the degree of smoothness  of the
  regression function is known."
