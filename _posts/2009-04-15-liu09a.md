title: Estimation Consistency of the Group Lasso and its Applications
abstract: We extend the  \ell_2-consistency result of (Meinshausen and Yu 2008) from
  the Lasso to  the group Lasso. Our main theorem shows that the group Lasso  achieves
  estimation consistency under a mild condition and an asymptotic upper bound on the
  number of selected variables can be obtained.  As a result, we can apply the nonnegative
  garrote procedure to the group Lasso result to obtain an estimator which is simultaneously  estimation  and
  variable selection consistent.  In particular,  our setting allows both the number
  of groups and the number of variables per  group increase and thus is applicable
  to high-dimensional problems.  We also provide   estimation consistency analysis
  for a version of the sparse additive models with increasing dimensions. Some finite-sample
  results are also reported.
