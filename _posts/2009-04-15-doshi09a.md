title: Variational Inference for the Indian Buffet Process
abstract: The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a nonparametric prior for latent feature
  models in which observations are influenced by a combination of several hidden features.  For
  example, images may be composed of several objects or sounds may consist of several
  notes.  Latent feature models seek to infer what these latent features from a set
  of observations. Current inference methods for the IBP have all relied on sampling.  While
  these methods are guaranteed to be accurate in the limit, in practice, samplers
  for the IBP tend to mix slow.  We develop a deterministic variational method for
  the IBP.  We provide theoretical guarantees on its truncation bounds and demonstrate
  its superior performance for high dimensional data sets.
