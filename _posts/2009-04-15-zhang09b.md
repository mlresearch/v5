title: Latent Variable Models for Dimensionality Reduction
abstract: Principal coordinate analysis (PCO), as a duality of principal component
  analysis (PCA), is also a classical method for explanatory data analysis.  In this
  paper we propose a probabilistic PCO by using a normal latent variable model in
  which   maximum likelihood estimation and an expectation-maximization algorithm
  are respectively devised to calculate the configurations of objects in a low-dimensional
  Euclidean space. We also devise probabilistic formulations for kernel PCA which
  is a nonlinear extension of PCA.
