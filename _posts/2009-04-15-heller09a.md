title: Infinite Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models
abstract: In this paper we present the Infinite Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (IHHMM),
  a nonparametric generalization of Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMMs). HHMMs
  have been used for modeling sequential data in applications such as speech recognition,
  detecting topic transitions in video and extracting information from text. The IHHMM
  provides more flexible modeling of sequential data by allowing a potentially unbounded
  number of levels in the hierarchy, instead of requiring the specification of a fixed
  hierarchy depth.  Inference and learning are performed efficiently using Gibbs sampling
  and a modified forward-backtrack algorithm. We show encouraging demonstrations of
  the workings of the IHHMM.
