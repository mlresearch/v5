title: Network Completion and Survey Sampling
abstract: We study the problem of learning the topology of an undirected network  by
  observing a random subsample.  Specifically, the sample is chosen by  randomly selecting
  a fixed number of vertices, and for each we are allowed  to observe all edges it
  is incident with.  We analyze a general formalization  of learning from such samples,
  and derive confidence bounds on the number  of differences between the true and
  learned topologies, as a function of  the number of observed mistakes and the algorithm's
  bias.  In addition to this  general analysis, we also analyze a variant of the problem
  under a stochastic  block model assumption.
