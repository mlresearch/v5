title: Dual Temporal Difference Learning
abstract: Recently, researchers have investigated novel dual representations  as a
  basis for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithms.  Although the
  convergence properties of classical dynamic programming  algorithms have been established
  for dual representations, temporal  difference learning algorithms have not yet
  been analyzed.  In this paper,  we study the convergence properties of temporal
  difference learning using  dual representations.  We contribute significant progress
  by proving the  convergence of dual temporal difference learning with eligibility
  traces.  Experimental results suggest that the dual algorithms seem to demonstrate  empirical
  benefits over standard primal algorithms.
