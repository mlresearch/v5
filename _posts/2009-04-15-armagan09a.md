title: Variational Bridge Regression
abstract: Here we obtain approximate Bayes inferences through variational methods
  when an exponential power family type prior is specified for the regression coefficients
  to mimic the characteristics of the Bridge regression. We accomplish this through
  hierarchical modeling of such priors. Although the mixing distribution is not explicitly
  stated for scale normal mixtures, we obtain the required moments only to attain
  the variational distributions for the regression coefficients. By choosing specific
  values of hyper-parameters (tuning parameters) present in the model, we can mimic
  the model selection performance of best subset selection in sparse underlying settings.
  The fundamental difference between MAP, \emphmaximum a posteriori, estimation and
  the proposed method is that, here we can obtain approximate inferences besides a
  point estimator. We also empirically analyze the frequentist properties of the estimator
  obtained. Results suggest that the proposed method yields an estimator that performs
  significantly better in sparse underlying setups than the existing state-of-the-art
  procedures in both n>p and p>n scenarios.
