title: PAC-Bayes Analysis Of Maximum Entropy Classification
abstract: We extend and apply the PAC-Bayes theorem to the analysis of maximum entropy
  learning by considering maximum entropy classification. The theory introduces a
  multiple sampling technique that controls an effective margin of the bound. We further
  develop a dual implementation of the convex optimisation that optimises the bound.
  This algorithm is tested on some simple datasets and the value of the bound compared
  with the test error.
